        <h1 id="monad-is-trash">Monad is trash</h1>
<p>This post is about some of my new ideas on programming language
design, although the title sounds quite off.</p>
<p>But, monad is just trash.</p>
<h2 id="monad-in-haskell-is-trash">Monad in Haskell is trash</h2>
<p>Monad is used mostly for these purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imperative paradigm with limited support of control flow.</li>
<li>Side effect tracking, e.g. <code>IO a</code> which tracks I/O
operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the drawbacks are bizarre:</p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to control flow, for example, one has to achieve <a
href="../20250304-fp-early-return">early return</a> via throwing
exceptions and setting up handlers.</li>
<li>The <code>IO a</code> effect is the "worst" effect, as mentioned in
the <a
href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-effect-types">Koka
book</a>, for covering up all the important sub-effects that users might
need for fine-grained control:
<ul>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>Divergence (a function might not terminate)</li>
<li>Non-determinism (e.g. generating random numbers)</li>
<li>Console</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Filesystem</li>
<li>UI (graphics system)</li>
<li>Heap allocation/read/write</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Why would Haskell put these altogether? Because making effects
extensible is not trivial at all. <code>IO a</code> is just a plain data
type, imagine one prints some text to the console and writes some bytes
to a file, what return type would be suitable for the program entrypoint
<code>main</code>?</p>
<p>Instead of calling it <code>IO a</code>, there are essentially two
worlds in Haskell: the <em>impure</em> (effect-ful) and the
<em>pure</em> (effect-free). And as we know, getting back to the pure is
<em>unsafe</em> (<code>unsafePerformIO</code>).</p>
<p>One still has the choice to use third-party libraries for extensible
effects. Just see how many there are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects"><code>fused-effects</code></a></li>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-simple"><code>freer-simple</code></a></li>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effectful"><code>effectful</code></a></li>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extensible-effects"><code>extensible-effects</code></a></li>
<li><a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy"><code>polysemy</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not intrigued to know about their differences. See those language
extensions, they might look terrifying for you, but I'm not scared. This
is how it would look without good <em>compile-time evaluation</em> and
<em>static reflection</em> support (if these two features remind you of
C++, you got the joke). Check out Lean 4 and Scala 3, see how they
trivialize the problems.</p>
<p>Koka trivializes extensible effects with <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2061">scoped labels</a> (i.e. effects
could be duplicate). Note that it's nothing related to the fancy
"algebraic effect" feature, it's only about (type system for) "effect
types". So unsurprisingly, it's not new: Koka nailed it in 2014, more
than a decade ago.</p>
<p>If you're still not convinced, let me show you these banger lines
from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486610.3486893">Safer
exceptions in Scala</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dealing with one monad at a time is straightforward but dealing with
several monads together is much less pleasant since monads do not
compose well. A great number of techniques have been proposed,
implemented, and promoted to deal with this, from monad transformers, to
free monads, to tagless final. None of these techniques is universally
liked, however; each introduces a complicated DSL with runtime overhead
that is both hard to understand for non-experts and hard to debug. In
the end, many developers prefer to work instead in a single
“super-monad” like ZIO that has error propagation built-in alongside
other aspects. This one-size-fits-all approach can work nicely for
frameworks that offer a fixed set of capabilities, but its fixed
overhead and lack of flexibility make it unsuitable as the only provided
solution for a general purpose programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, now, get ready for time to cook Koka...</p>
<h2 id="effect-is-far-from-enough">Effect is far from enough</h2>
<p>There are still further issues despite an effect is "monadic" or
"algebraic", the most important one is called
<strong>coeffect</strong>.</p>
<p>It sounds like some annoying category theorists speaking in tongues.
But for most of the time it's just about a simple concept,
<em>"resource"</em>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">void</span> <span class="op">*</span>p <span class="op">=</span> malloc<span class="op">(</span><span class="kw">sizeof</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">int</span><span class="op">));</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above example, one typically <em>expects</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only <code>p</code> points to the resource (<em>memory</em>),</li>
<li>To close (reclaim) the resource wisely, or,</li>
<li>To transfer the resource, and the transferee should take further
care of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, the <code>p</code> is a coeffect, a handle, a descriptor, a
resource, and any similar names you would drop.</p>
<p>Usually, people use the <em>state monad</em> <code>ST s a</code> to
simulate this situation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode hs"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">import</span> <span class="dt">Control.Monad.ST</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">import</span> <span class="dt">Data.STRef</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">app ::</span> <span class="dt">ST</span> s <span class="dt">Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>app <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  ref <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> newSTRef <span class="dv">0</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  modifySTRef ref (<span class="op">+</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  readSTRef ref</span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">main ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>main <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="fu">print</span> <span class="op">$</span> runST app</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you're confused with the type parameter <code>s</code>, the type
of variable <code>ref</code> is <code>STRef s Int</code>. If one
attempts to return <code>ref</code> for leaking the resource, this
<code>s</code> from <code>ref</code> would not be able to reference that
from <code>app</code> itself, since <code>runST</code> has a pretty
special type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode hs"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">runST ::</span> (<span class="kw">forall</span> s<span class="op">.</span> <span class="dt">ST</span> s a) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">--               ^             ^</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">--               |             |</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">--               |             +--- Impossible to reference that inner `s`.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">--               |</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">--               +--- `s` is only available inside `app`.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So <code>s</code> is a hack, and poor Haskell has to enable the
<code>RankNTypes</code> language extension for this.</p>
<p>What's worse? Everyone is using this trick:</p>
<ul>
<li>Koka would <a
href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-runst">try to
eliminate</a> the internal <code>st&lt;h&gt;</code> effect by running
<code>runST</code> on the function. If the resource is leaked, the
compiler is able to leave that specific effect, and does better than
Haskell.</li>
<li>Rust's lifetime parameter is the same thing, and Clippy (Rust
linter) will tell you if one could elide a fully generic lifetime
parameter by, yup, running <code>runST</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's even worse? People really want to track other kinds of
resources, e.g. files, sockets, threads, locks... It's stupid to have
all of them built-in, but Koka has no better ideas yet.</p>
<p>And so far, you might already notice a terrible truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Koka marks the effect <code>alloc&lt;h&gt;</code>, if one leaks the
allocated memory to its caller.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means, <strong>a coeffect system is often coupled with the
effect system</strong>, they need to work well together, not just in
isolation.</p>
<p>You would see people keep talking about the fancy algebraic effects,
or the classic linear/affine logic (for coeffects). But the truth is, we
need to take both.</p>
<h2 id="open-problem">Open problem</h2>
<p>Now we've understood the background of this open problem. There are
already many attempts from the greats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a

Effects and Coeffects via Grading (ICFP '16)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bentnib.org/quantitative-type-theory.html">The
Syntax and Semantics of Quantitative Type Theory (LICS '18)</a>
<ul>
<li>This paper is just about coeffects, but we have an implementation to
play around: Idris 2!</li>

<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3689750">Effects and
Coeffects in Call-by-Push-Value (OOPSLA '24)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't dived deep enough into these works. Not to mention in that
<em>ICFP '16 paper</em> above, there are <strong>16 additional
laws</strong> beyond the basic typing rules for the
<em>effect-over-coeffect</em> and <em>coeffect-over-effect</em> setups.
It's hard to convince myself such system is practical enough for the end
users.</p>
<h2 id="my-attempts">My attempts</h2>
<p>I'm not a professional for making and proving novelty. I just try
collecting these existing ideas.</p>
<h3 id="modality">Modality</h3>
<p>First off, what to be attached with the information of a coeffect
(e.g. how many times a variable should be used exactly, or at most)? The
options are two: Adding new types or adding to existing constructs (e.g.
bindings and functions).</p>
<p>Most systems decided to attach coeffects with a dedicated new set of
types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> in C++, a unique pointer
should be used exactly once (move semantics), and one could achieve this
in a custom type with its copy constructor and copy assignment operator
all deleted. And then people shoot their feet using
<code>use-after-move</code> for fun.</li>
<li><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> type and <code>Copy</code> trait in Rust,
much saner.</li>
<li>That ICFP '16 paper, and many linear/affine logic papers, mostly you
could see <code>box T</code>/<code>unbox T</code> type operators, and
some even used <code>🔒 T</code>/<code>🔓 T</code> to <a
href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/gratzer-sterling-birkedal-2019.xml">look
cool</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's just straightforward to use a type former for constructing a
coeffect, and a type eliminator for destructing it. People are so used
to it. The drawbacks are not apparent, until you relate to monads:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's hard to compose or extend such constructs:
<ul>
<li>You've seen the types <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;T</code>
and <code>&amp;mut T</code> in Rust coming out of nowhere. You've seen
implicit rules like <code>&amp;Box&lt;T&gt;</code> would be seamlessly
used as <code>&amp;T</code>, but when it fails to work, one writes
<code>a.as_ref()</code> instead of <code>&amp;a</code>.</li>
<li>You don't see any resources like files are able to track using
exactly the approach for types like <code>&amp;T</code>. The manual
tells you to use RAII and the <code>Drop</code> trait.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More and more primitive types are added to the compiler, more rules
are added for them being poorly composable and extendable.
<ul>
<li>You might feel weird about why even the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>
type comes from the void, isn't there just <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html">source code
for it</a>? Then read more carefully and you would find the comment
above it:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The declaration of the <code>Box</code> struct must be kept in sync
with the compiler or ICEs will happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the alternative approach looks quite intriguing: <strong>Adding
(co)effects to existing types</strong>. That's how modality works in
Koka and Idris 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Koka adds effect types on function types and (so naturally) the
function definitions.</li>
<li>Idris 2 adds coeffects on function parameters only.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it might be interesting if we can specify effects and coeffects
in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function parameters</li>
<li>Variable declarators (a.k.a. bindings), not just parameters</li>
<li>Function types</li>
</ul>
<p>We will give code examples to show how. Here comes the next
question.</p>
<h3 id="handling-coeffects">Handling coeffects</h3>
<p>How to define a function that closes/reclaims a resource? Of course,
we should not use the <code>s</code>/<code>runST</code> trick again.</p>
<p>My initial thought tells me one could also specify this behavior
<em>using parameters and variable declarators</em>. But the biggest
concern might be, if there is a variable with unlimited usage (e.g. of a
primitive arithmetic type), every use of it might not be considered as
some resource reclamation. Or simply it's just not a resource, since it
won't be running out.</p>
<p>By far, we should end up with something like Koka and Idris 2
altogether.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Below are the personal ideas. Feel free to judge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's write some code in a new language toy like C. We declare the
prototypes of <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>, as the
lowest-level memory management primitives (although
<code>aligned_alloc</code> should be better):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">void</span> <span class="op">*</span>malloc<span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">size_t</span> sz<span class="op">);</span></span>

<p>We define a new effect for memory allocation:</p>

<p>We write their overloaded functions for convenience. But we enforce
that overloaded definitions should be always inline and fully evaluated
at compile-time. They won't really reside in any translation units.</p>

<h2 id="more-thoughts">More thoughts?</h2>
<p>We're still pretty far from changing the game, obviously. Some
problems that are still very challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible pointer types. Pointers could be:
<ul>
<li>Of weird semantics with the <code>void *</code>.</li>
<li>Immutable and mutable references (or views) of some existing
pointers. There are related <a
href="https://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/HTMLTOC/c3321.html#views_for_pointers">practices
in ATS using view types</a> for accesses.</li>
<li>Restrict (for aliasing), just like <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and
<code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>In, out, inout parameters.</li>
<li>Used for pointer arithmetic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fully/partially initialized and uninitialized memory.</li>
<li>For the problems above, their interactions with struct fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I should get back for the journey...</p>
